# Dining Kotlinners

This is my solution to the dining philosophers programming assignment
I was assigned in my Operating Systems. I've had a growing curiosity 
about Kotlin, and the experience writing this was alright. The syntax 
of the language is pretty nice, but I don't really enjoy Gradle. I 
might try Maven next time I work with Kotlin. Gradle builds are super 
slow. The solution does hardcode apetite and number of philosophers, 
but that could be parameterized quite easily.
